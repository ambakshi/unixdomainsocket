Unix Domain Socket
------------------

MIT LICENSE

Simple cli program that implements a forking
unix domain socket echo server/client. Use as
a base to implement 'CLI server' as described
by ESR in 'The Art of Unix Programming'. Mainly
an example for LF, as an April Fool's joke. Except
that it really works.
